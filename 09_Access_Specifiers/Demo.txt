The are four ways of defining the access permisions of a variable.
If you don't put a keyword before the variable name,
you are using the default access level modifier.

- public allows access from anywhere else.
- protected allows access from inside the package and the class' subclasses.
- default modifier (blank) allows access only from inside the package.
- private allows access only from inside the class.

Protected and default are quite similar.
(default is also known as package private)
